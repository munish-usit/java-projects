 * DESCRIPTION - This class is responsible to initialize all data with hard coded values. Data has been initialized from the standard I/O in the problem pdf.

 * It initializes following objects:
 * 	-	List of all possible weathers
 *  - 	List of available vehicles
 *  -  	List of routes/orbits, and its corresponding details.
 *  Note: In real time application, these values will be retrieved from database or file system or through any third party web service.
